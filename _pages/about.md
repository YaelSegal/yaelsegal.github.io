Bio
====

My name is Yael Segal-Feldman, I'm an AI researcher with a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [Technion – Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/), where I was advised by [Prof. Joseph Keshet](https://keshet.net.technion.ac.il/). My research introduced the concept of the *Speech Object* and focused on its representation across multiple levels. I’ve developed algorithms for keyword spotting, spoken term detection, diadochokinetic (DDK) tasks, and pitch tracking.

Currently, I work at [**aiOla**](https://aiola.ai/), where I build speech and language technologies that turn cutting-edge research into real-world products. My interests include multilingual and low-resource systems, as well as emerging techniques like speculative decoding.
