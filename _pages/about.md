Bio
====
My name is Yael Segal. I am a Computer-Science PhD candidate at [Bar-Ilan University](https://www1.biu.ac.il/)
under the supervision of [Prof. Joseph Keshet](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~jkeshet/). My research interests are in
machine-learning, deep-learning and their applications in detection and localization of speech objects, specifically keyword spotting, spoken term detection and Diadochokinetic (DDK) .
